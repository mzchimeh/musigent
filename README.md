# 🎵 Musigent — AI Music Creative Agent
*A multi-agent AI system that generates copyright-safe jingles, background music, and personalized music personas.*

Musigent is a creative AI agent system built for the **Kaggle 5-Day Agents Intensive Capstone Project**, powered by 
a multi-agent architecture using Planner, Composer, and Quality evaluation agents. It helps content creators, 
brands, and social media users generate **original, copyright-safe audio tailored to their needs.**

---

## Features

## 1. Jingle Generator  
Create short, catchy, brand-ready audio logos.

## 2. Background Music Composer  
Generate copyright-safe ambient or cinematic tracks for:
- YouTube videos  
- Instagram reels  
- TikTok posts  
- Podcasts  

## 3. Personal Music Persona  
Analyze a user's taste (mocked Spotify integration) and:
- Build a music persona  
- Compose a personalized track  
- Suggest a style based on preferences  

## 4. Time Tool  
Provides UTC timestamp metadata for each generation.  
Used to track creation time and support future observability.

## 5. Multi-Agent Reasoning Pipeline  
Musigent uses:
- **PlannerAgent** → interprets request, defines structure  
- **ComposerAgent** → generates (mock) audio  
- **QualityAgent** → evaluates originality + style match  
- **MemoryStore** → keeps track of interactions  

## 6. User Daily Limit (Anti-Spam Protection)  
Each unique username can request **up to 5 jingles per day (UTC)**.  
Daily usage is tracked in the JSON-based `MemoryStore` and resets automatically at midnight UTC.  
This prevents abuse and supports fair usage in the capstone environment.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The system follows a clean multi-agent flow:

User Request → PlannerAgent → ComposerAgent → QualityAgent → Final Output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **FastAPI** (for simple API demo)
- **Uvicorn** (local dev server)
- **Pydantic** (request/response models)
- **Mock Suno + Spotify Tools** (extendable to real APIs)
- **Simple JSON Memory Store**
- **Kaggle Notebook Integration**
- **GitHub Version Control**
- **External HTTP Geolocation Request** (Google Geolocation API for timestamp + user-limit tracking)

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

1. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start FastAPI
```
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

3. Open in browser
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Example usage:
```
from musigent.runner import MusigentRunner

runner = MusigentRunner()

runner.handle_request(
    mode="jingle",
    prompt="modern startup jingle",
    duration_sec=15
)
```
This returns:

**A — The plan**  
**B — The (mocked) generated audio**  
**C — The evaluation score**

# 📡 On Kaggle

To use this project inside a Kaggle notebook:

```
!git clone https://github.com/mzchimeh/musigent.git
import sys
sys.path.append("/kaggle/working/musigent")

# Future Work

Planned improvements include:

1. Integration with real Suno API for audio generation  
2. Integration with Spotify OAuth for true taste modeling  
3. Enhanced originality scoring  
4. Fully hosted web UI  
5. Optional vector database for richer memory retention  
6. Deployment via Google Cloud’s Agent Engine
